## assignment 1,2,3
### These three assigments are a complete guessing word game. The game involves trying to guess an unknown word. The guessing of the word is done in 11 steps. In Step 1 of the game the player guesses a 2 letter sub-word corresponding to the first two letters of the unknown word. They score 20 points for any of the guessed letters which are in the word (but not in the correct position) and 100 points for any letter in the correct position. In Step 2 the player guesses a 3 letter sub-word to correspond to the first three letters of the unknown word. In Step 3 the player suggests another 3 letter sub-word to correspond to letters 2 to 4 of the unknown word, and the usual scoring system holds. In Step 4 the player suggests another 3 letter sub-word to correspond to letters 3 to 5 of the unknown word. In Step 5 they guess a 3 letter sub-word to correspond to letters 4 to 6 of the unknown word.
## User Interface Design for Microscopy Image Analysis Platform
### User Interface Design for Microscopy Image Analysis Platform is a software to display the different structures of the target cells. Biomedical scientists can implement the functionalities on the interface of this platform to do overlapping effect on the same image or enhance the resolution of a specific structure of the target cells. This technique is to improve their understanding about their target cells.
